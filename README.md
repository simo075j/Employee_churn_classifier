# Employee churn classifier: Project summary.

* Created a classification model in Rstudio to determine employee churn(attrition) with a F1 score of 65.

* Preprocessing techniques include: Discretisation, lumping, One-hot encoding, factorisation.

* Trained and optimised a Logistic regression and Elastic net with one standard error and cross validation to reach the best model.

* Trough feature importance extraction, the top causes for employee churn is ranked, analysed and presented
